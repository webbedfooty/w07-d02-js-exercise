  <p> When you click <a href="#">This Link</a>, list items with a class of
  "list-item" should turn orange. When you click <a href="#">this link</a>, they
  should return to whatever color they would be otherwise (this might change if
  you click on those items). This should override whether they are purple or
  not.</p>

  <p>When you click<a href="#">This link</a>, the above paragraph should
  disappear. When you click <a href="#">This link</a>, it should reappear.</p>

  <p>When you click <a href="#">this link</a>, the above paragraph should gain a
  blue blackground. When you click that link again, it should become orange.

  background.</p>

  <p>When you click <a href="#">this link</a>, the word "Week" in the title
  (defined in the head) and in the h1 should both become "Eon". When you click
  the h1, both the h1 and the title should go back to saying "Week" (instead of
  "Eon").</p>

  left-justified to right-justified.</p>

  returns the link text to what it was before and makes the picture
  disappear.</p>

  something happens in the above paragraph -->
